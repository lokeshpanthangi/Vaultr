# VaultBox: Core Functionality & User Flows Implementation

## Security & Authentication Implementation

### User Authentication
- Implement secure email/password authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Include two-factor authentication option using authenticator apps
- Create secure session management with JWT tokens that expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Implement device recognition system with option to approve/reject new devices
- Password requirements: 12+ characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts with time-based unlock

### Real-time Security Features
- Implement WebSocket connections for instant security notifications
- Create encrypted local storage for temporary session data
- Develop client-side AES-256 encryption for all vault content before sending to server
- Build key derivation function from master password to generate encryption keys
- Implement encrypted backup system with cloud storage integration
- Add audit log for all security-related actions

## Core Functionality Implementation

### 1. Vault Entry System
- **Entry Creation Flow**:
  - Multi-step wizard interface for creating new entries
  - Category selection with custom category option
  - Rich text editor for content with markdown support
  - File upload with preview and encryption progress indicator
  - Security options panel with toggles for:
    - Auto-deletion date picker with visual timeline
    - Emergency access toggle (Yes/No)
    - Trusted contact visibility settings
  - Save action with encryption animation

- **Entry Management**:
  - Batch actions for multiple entries (delete, change category, update access)
  - Search functionality with encrypted content searching
  - Filter system by category, date, access level
  - Sort options by creation date, title, expiration
  - Bulk import/export with encryption options
  - Version history tracking for each entry

### 2. Trusted Contact System
- **Contact Management Interface**:
  - Add trusted contact form with email verification
  - Trust level configuration (what they can access)
  - Waiting period configuration before access granted
  - Notification preferences for contact access attempts
  - Remove/replace trusted contact with confirmation steps
  - Test notification system to verify contact setup

- **Access Request Processing**:
  - Request notification with urgency level indicator
  - Time-remaining counter for automatic access grant
  - Manual override options (grant now, deny permanently)
  - Access grant confirmation with detailed audit trail
  - Communication channel to trusted contact with encryption
  - Temporary access code generation for one-time access

### 3. Emergency Unlock Flow
- **For Trusted Contact**:
  - Simple landing page to request access with minimal friction
  - Identity verification steps
  - Reason for access request form
  - Clear expectations about waiting period
  - Status indicator showing request progress
  - Notification setup for when access is granted

- **For Vault Owner**:
  - Push notification and email alert system
  - Emergency access request dashboard
  - Detailed information about request (who, when, why)
  - Quick action buttons (approve, deny, delay)
  - Automated response if no action taken within time limit
  - Access revocation tools even after automatic grant

### 4. Timeline & Status Visualization
- **Interactive Timeline UI**:
  - Chronological display of all vault activities
  - Visual differentiation between entry types
  - Status indicators with color coding:
    - Active (teal glow)
    - Locked (blue pulse)
    - Shared (amber highlight)
    - Expiring Soon (red pulsing countdown)
  - Expiration warnings with visual countdown
  - Filtering options for timeline view
  - Timeline zoom levels (day, week, month, year)

### 5. Notification System
- **Notification Center**:
  - Central notification hub with categorized alerts
  - Priority levels for different notification types
  - Read/unread status with visual indicators
  - Action buttons directly within notifications
  - Notification preference settings
  - History log of all past notifications

- **Alert Types Implementation**:
  - Access requests (highest priority, red)
  - Expiring entries (high priority, amber)
  - Inactivity warnings (medium priority, blue)
  - System updates (low priority, gray)
  - Custom notification scheduler for recurring alerts

## Database & Backend Implementation

### Database Schema
- Users table with authentication data
- Vault entries table with encrypted content
- Trusted contacts relationship table
- Access requests tracking table
- Activity logs and audit trails
- Notification records

### API Endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset)
- Vault CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete entries)
- Trusted contact management endpoints
- Emergency access request handlers
- Notification delivery and management
- User preference and settings management

### Security Implementation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- CSRF protection with secure tokens
- XSS prevention with content sanitization
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## WebSocket Implementation
- Real-time notification delivery
- Live status updates for emergency access requests
- Session monitoring for multi-device logins
- Typing indicators for shared vault spaces
- Connection status indicators
- Fallback to polling if WebSockets unavailable

## Mobile Responsiveness & PWA Support
- Implement as Progressive Web App for installation on devices
- Offline mode with encrypted local cache
- Push notification support on supported platforms
- Touch-optimized interfaces for mobile
- Biometric authentication integration where available
- Responsive layouts adapting to all screen sizes
