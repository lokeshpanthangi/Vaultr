Notification System Overview
Create a comprehensive notification and alerts system for VaultBox that keeps users informed about critical security events through both in-app notifications and email alerts (simulated). The notification system should feel security-focused, timely, and provide clear actionable information.

In-App Notification Center
Visual Design
Design a notification bell icon in the top navigation bar with:
Unread count indicator (red badge)
Dropdown panel for notification display
Clear visual hierarchy between read/unread notifications
Use color-coding for notification priorities:
Red: Emergency access attempts
Orange: Expiring entries
Yellow: Inactivity warnings
Blue: Informational updates
Notification Components
Create a notification card component with:

Icon representing notification type
Brief notification text
Timestamp
Read/unread status indicator
Action buttons relevant to the notification type
Dismiss option
Implement notification grouping by type:

"Access Requests" section
"Expiring Content" section

Real-Time Alerts
Design overlay alert components for critical notifications that appear immediately:
Non-intrusive toast notifications for less critical alerts
Modal alerts for emergency access attempts that require action
Banner alerts for system-wide notifications

Implementation Notes
All notification timestamps should respect user's timezone
Provide notification frequency throttling to prevent alert fatigue
