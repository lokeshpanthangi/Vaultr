# Replit Project Modification Request: Add Trusted User Feature

I need help modifying my existing project to add a "Trusted User" feature that focuses on emergency access and selective record sharing. Here are the specific requirements:

## Core Trusted User Functionality:

1. **Trusted Contact Setup:**
   - Allow users to designate one trusted contact via email
   - This trusted contact cannot access anything by default
   - Access is only granted under two specific conditions:
     - The primary user is inactive for a configurable period (X days)
     - OR the primary user explicitly shares specific records

2. **Emergency Unlock Flow:**
   - Create a "Vault Request" page for trusted contacts
   - Trusted contact provides their email and requests unlock
   - System notifies vault owner: "Your trusted contact is attempting to access your vault"
   - If vault owner doesn't log in within configured time period (default: 7 days):
     - Selected/shared entries become visible to trusted contact

3. **Activity Tracking:**
   - Implement a system to track user login activity
   - Reset inactivity timer whenever user logs in
   - Track the configurable inactivity threshold (X days)

## Implementation Requirements:

1. **New Sidebar Navigation Item:**
   - Add a new tab/link in the sidebar labeled "Trusted User"
   - This should only be visible to users who are designated as trusted users for other accounts

2. **New Trusted User Page:**
   - Create a new page that displays when the "Trusted User" tab is clicked
   - The page should show all data being shared with the current user from other accounts
   - Display which users have designated the current user as their trusted user
   - Show status of emergency access requests (pending/granted)

3. **Data Display Requirements:**
   - Show a list of accounts for which the current user is a trusted contact
   - For each account, display what specific records are being shared
   - Include timestamps for when access was granted
   - Clearly distinguish between explicitly shared records and emergency access

## Technical Context:
- The project already has user authentication
- Need data models to track:
  - Trusted contact relationships
  - Inactivity periods
  - Emergency access requests
  - Explicitly shared records
- Ensure proper security measures so users can only see data explicitly shared with them

## UI/UX Requirements:
- The trusted user page should have a clean, organized layout
- Include a header explaining what a trusted user is
- Group shared data by the user who shared it
- Clearly differentiate between emergency access and explicitly shared records

Please help implement this in a way that integrates seamlessly with my existing code structure and UI design. Let me know if you need more information about my current project architecture to make appropriate modifications.
