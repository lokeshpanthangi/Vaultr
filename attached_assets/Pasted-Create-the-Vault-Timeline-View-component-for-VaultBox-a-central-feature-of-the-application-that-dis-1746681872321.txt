Create the Vault Timeline View component for VaultBox, a central feature of the application that displays all user-stored encrypted entries in a chronological timeline format. This view provides users with a comprehensive overview of their vault contents with clear status indicators, expiration warnings, and encrypted previews, allowing for easy management and interaction with their sensitive information.
Design Principles

Security-focused dark interface with vault-like aesthetics
Clean, organized timeline presentation for optimal information scanning
Strong visual status indicators that communicate entry states at a glance
Intuitive interaction patterns for viewing, editing, and deleting entries
Responsive design adapting seamlessly from mobile to desktop

Frontend Components to Implement
1. Main Timeline Interface

Create a scrollable, filterable timeline of all vault entries
Each entry should be displayed as a card with:

Title prominently displayed
Category indicator with appropriate icon (Finance, Health, Personal, Notes)
Creation/modification date
Prominent status badge (color-coded):

Active (green) - Normal, accessible entry
Locked (blue) - Extra security measures applied
Shared (orange) - Designated for trusted contact access
Expiring Soon (red) - Approaching auto-deletion date


Masked content preview (e.g., "████████████" or partially visible first line)
Clear interaction buttons (View, Edit, Delete)


Implement smooth animations for expanding/collapsing entry details

2. Timeline Filtering & Search

Category filter buttons/dropdown to show only entries of a specific type
Status filter to view entries by their current state
Search box to quickly locate entries by title or content
Date range selector to view entries created within a specific timeframe
Sort options (newest first, oldest first, alphabetical, expiring soonest)

3. Entry Detail Expansion

Clicking an entry expands it to show:

Full encrypted content (still masked until explicitly revealed)
Detailed metadata (creation date, last modified, auto-delete date if set)
Advanced options (change category, modify auto-delete settings)
Trusted contact sharing settings
"Reveal Content" button with appropriate security confirmation



4. Status & Warning Systems

Visual countdown timers for entries approaching auto-deletion
Pulsing animation for entries with active alerts/warnings
Modal confirmations for critical actions (delete, change visibility)
Tooltip explanations for each status type
Warning banner for entries accessible to trusted contacts

5. Entry Management Actions

Intuitive edit mode with save/cancel options
Secure delete process with confirmation
Option to extend/modify auto-delete timeframes
Toggle controls for trusted contact visibility
"Create Similar" option to duplicate entry structure

Database Requirements

Store entry metadata separately from encrypted content
Track status changes and modification history
Store expiration/auto-delete timestamps
Maintain relationship between entries and trusted contact access permissions

API Endpoints Needed

GET /api/vault/entries - Retrieve all entries for timeline view
GET /api/vault/entries/ - Get specific entry details
PUT /api/vault/entries/ - Update entry content or settings
DELETE /api/vault/entries/ - Remove an entry
PATCH /api/vault/entries//status - Update just the entry status

Interaction Patterns

Timeline Browsing Flow:

User scrolls through chronological list of entries
Can quickly scan status indicators and titles
Filter and search to locate specific entries


Entry Management Flow:

Tap/click entry to expand details
Secondary click on reveal button to see actual content
Edit option opens inline form or modal
Delete triggers confirmation dialog emphasizing permanent action


Status Management Flow:

Clear visual indicators when an entry is approaching expiration
One-click extension of auto-delete timeframes
Toggle controls for changing entry status (e.g., marking as shared for emergency access)



Visual Design Elements

Implement a time-axis visualization (vertical or horizontal)
Use subtle connecting elements between timeline entries
Include vault-themed iconography for different entry types and statuses
Apply consistent color-coding for status indicators
Create microinteractions that reinforce security (unlocking animations, secure deletion effects)

Ensure the interface balances information density with clarity, providing users a complete overview of their vault contents while emphasizing the secure nature of the application through appropriate visual cues and confirmation patterns.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
